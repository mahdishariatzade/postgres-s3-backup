## 2026-02-23 - Command Injection in backup.sh via eval
**Vulnerability:** Use of `eval` with unvalidated environment variables (`S3_BUCKET`, `S3_PREFIX`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `S3_ENDPOINT`) allowed for arbitrary command execution.
**Learning:** The `eval` command is dangerous when used with input that can be influenced by users or external systems. In bash, optional arguments can be handled safely using arrays instead of building a command string for `eval`.
**Prevention:** Avoid `eval` whenever possible. Use bash arrays for dynamic command arguments and always quote variables to prevent word splitting and globbing. Use `--` to signal the end of command options when passing variables that might start with a hyphen.
